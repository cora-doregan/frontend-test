# Goal

Create a React application that retrieves and displays a Github users repositories.

## Creating the project

Use Typescript and any third party libraries you like. This project is about evaluating your skill and learning about your prefernces and style.

## UX/UI

The application should include 
* An input to enter a github users username
* A button to retrieve the entered users data
* A pie chart to display the users repositories by language
* A table to display the users repositories with the below columns
  Repo name, Language, Date created, Date updated  

## Additional functionality

* Add a different chart type that displays some other data by modifying the getUserData api call
* Add an indicator when data is loading
* Add sorting functionality to the repositories table
* Deal with errors coming from Github

## Retrieving data

To make things easier we have commited a github-api.js file with the endpoints needed to retrieve the information.

## Submitting the solution

Copy this repository to a repository under your own github account. (Do not fork) It should be clear how to build and run the project locally. Once you have completed your work please notify us via email with your repository url.

## Evaluation

Your work will be evaluated for functional completeness based on the above stated goal. Additionally it will
be reviewed with the following criteria in mind:

* Project structure
* Implementation choices
* Readability and code cleanliness

Successful candidates will be asked to provide any insights regarding their choices and practices.
